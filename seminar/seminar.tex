\vspace{20pt}
The task of classifying unstructured document to the proper category to which it belongs to is become difficult task because the volume of information shared over the internet increase swiftly. Text classification is the task of allocating the document into one or more number of predefined categories. Additionally, this is very famous in the field of information retrieval, text summarization and so on. However, all the application areas transformation of text into feature vectors play the important role.Previously several text representation techniques have been proposed by different authors to capture the real semantics of the web documents, but this has become hinderance because of semantic mismatch and multiple meanings of words.\\
Thus, this seminar report proposes a word embedding to solve the document representation problem in Nepali news classification. To achieve this task, this seminar work utilizes Word2Vec and ELMo word embedding algorithms to represent documents. And which are also used in conjunction with Nepali news classification algorithm to determine the most effective embedding model. In this report two machine learning algorithm namely SVM and Random Forest are used.\\
Context dependent and independent word representation model are used in this seminar report. Here total of 5145 Nepali news is scraped from e-kantipur for analyzing these models with text classification model, to which it includes four different categories. All in all, the Random Forest machine learning algorithm provide the highest accuracy of 74 percent with the ELMo word representation. However, scenario with SVM looks different, it gives the highest accuracy of 68 percent with Word2Vec word vectorization model.\\
